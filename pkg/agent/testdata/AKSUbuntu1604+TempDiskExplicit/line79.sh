# Bind mount kubelet to ephemeral storage on startup, as necessary.
#
# This fixes an issue with kubelet's ability to detect allocatable
# capacity for Node ephemeral-storage. On Azure, ephemeral-storage
# should correspond to the temp disk if a VM has one. This script makes
# that true by bind mounting the temp disk to /var/lib/kubelet, so
# kubelet thinks it's located on the temp disk (/dev/sdb). This results
# in correct calculation of ephemeral-storage capacity.
