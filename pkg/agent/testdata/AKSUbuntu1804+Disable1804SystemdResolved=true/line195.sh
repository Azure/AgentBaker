# remove this if we are no longer using promiscuous bridge mode for containerd
# background: we get duplicated packets from pod to serviceIP if both are on the same node (one from the cbr0 bridge and one from the pod ip itself via kernel due to promiscuous mode being on)
# we should filter out the one from pod ip
