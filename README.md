# Agentbaker

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Azure/AgentBaker/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Azure/AgentBaker?branch=master)

Agentbaker is a collection of components used to provision Kubernetes nodes in Azure.

Agentbaker has a few pieces
- Packer templates and scripts to build VM images.
- A set of templates and a public API to render those templates given input config.
- An API to retrieve the latest VM image version for new clusters.

The primary consumer of Agentbaker is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

AKS uses Agentbaker to provision Linux and Windows Kubernetes nodes.

## Contributing

Developing agentbaker requires a few basic requisites:
- Go (at least version 1.19)
- Make

Run `make -C hack/tools install` to install all development tools.

If you change code or artifacts used to generate custom data or custom script extension payloads, you should run `make`.

This re-runs code to embed static files in Go code, which is what will actually be used at runtime.

This additionally runs unit tests (equivalent of `go test ./...`) and regenerates snapshot testdata.

## Style

We use [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) to enforce style.

Run `make -C hack/tools install` to install the linter.

Run `./hack/tools/bin/golangci-lint run` to run the linter.

We currently have many failures we hope to eliminate.

We have [job to run golangci-lint on pull requests]().

This job uses the linters "no-new-issues" feature.

As long as PRs don't introduce net new issues, they should pass.

We also have a linting job to enforce commit message style.

We adhere to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Prefer pull requests with single commits.

To clean up in-progress commits, you can use `git rebase -i` to fixup commits.

See the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#_squashing) for more details.

## Testing

Most code may be tested with vanilla Go unit tests.

## Snapshot

We also have snapshot data tests, which store the output of key APIs as files on disk.

We can manually verify the snapshot content looks correct.

We now have unit tests which can directly validate the content without leaving generated files on disk. 

See `./pkg/agent/baker_test.go` for examples (search for `dynamic-config-dir` to see a validation sample.).
