# Agentbaker E2E Testing

This directory contains all files pertaining to our own implementation of an E2E testing framework for AgentBaker.

E2E testing for Linux is currently implemented using a Golang framework built from the ground-up. Note that we soon plan on moving Windows over to this testing framework as well.

The goal of E2E testing with AgentBaker is to ensure that the node bootstrapping artifacts generted and returned by the primary AgentBaker API not only contain *expected* content, but also contain *correct* content that can be used as-is to bootstrap real Azure VMs so they can join real AKS clusters.

From a high-level, each E2E scenario makes a call out to the primary node-bootstrapping API (GetLatestNodeBootstrapping) with a set of parameters (represented by a NodeBootstrappingConfiugration) which define the given scenario to generate CSE and custom data. A new VMSS containing a single VM will then be created and associated with an AKS cluster that is already running in the Azure. The CSE and custom data generated by AgentBaker will then be applied to the new VM such that it can be properly bootstrapped and register itself with the apiserver of the running cluster. Liveness and health checks and then run to make sure the new VM's kubelet is posting NodeReady to the cluster's apiserver, and that workload pods can successfully be run on it. Lastly, a set of validation commands are remotely executed on the VM after it has successfully been bootstrapped to ensure that its live state (file existsnce, sysctl settings, etc.) is as expected.

## Running Locally

To run the Go implementation of the E2E test suite locally, simply use `e2e-local.sh`. This script will setup the call to `go test` for you while also implementing default logic for a set of required environment variables used to interact with Azure. These required environment variables include:

- `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - default `8ecadfc9-d1a3-4ea4-b844-0d9f87e4d7c8`
- `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` - defualt: `agentbaker-e2e-tests`
- `LOCATION` - default: `eastus`
- `CLUSTER_NAME` - default `agentbaker-e2e-test-cluster`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` - default: `72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47`

`SCENARIOS_TO_RUN` may also optionally be set to specify a subset of the E2E scenarios to run during the testing session as a comma-separated list, for example:

```bash
SCENARIOS_TO_RUN=base,gpu ./e2e-local.sh
```

**Note that when using `e2e-local.sh`, a timeout value of 30 minutes is applied to the `go test` command.**

You may also run the test command yourself assuming you've properly setup the required environment variables like so:

```bash
go test -timeout 30m -v -run Test_All ./
```

## Package Structure

The top-level package of the Golang E2E implementation is named `e2e_test` and is entirely separate from all AgentBaker packages.

The `e2e_test` package has a dependency on subpackage located in the [scenario](scenario/) directory. Package `scenario` is where all E2E scenarios are defined, each in their own separate files. This package also defines common [types](scenario/types.go) related to scenario and scenario configuration, as well as the hard-coded list of SIG version IDs located in [images.go](scenario/images.go) used for testing different OS distros. Package `scenario` also contains the implementation of common cluster selectors and mutators within [clusterconfiguration.go](scenario/clusterconfiguration.go), though each scenario could define their own implementations if needed.

The primary testing function is located in [suite_test.go](suite_test.go), which is run by `go test ...`.

## Scenarios

Minimally, each E2E scenario is parameterized with a set of "mutators" that change/set various properties of a base NodeBootstrappingConfiguration struct. This struct is then fed into GetLatestNodeBootstrapping to generate CSE and custom data. The most commonly mutated property of this struct across all scenarios is the OS distro. This is primarily because each scenario currently uses a separate VHD corresponding to the respective distro.

E2E scenarios can also be configured with VMSS configuration mutators that change/set properties on the VMSS model used to deploy the new VM to be bootstrapped. This is primarily useful when testing out different VM SKUs, especially for GPU-enabled scenarios which affect which code paths AgentBaker will use to generate CSE and custom data

Further, in order to support E2E scenarios which test different underlying AKS cluster configurations, such as the cluster's network plugin, each E2E scenario has its own "cluster selector" and "cluster mutator". Cluster selectors determine whether or not the given live AKS cluster is viable for running the given scenario, while cluster mutators will mutate a base AKS cluster model such that the model represents a cluster which is viable for running the given scenario. For example, a scenario meant to run on an AKS cluster configured with the kubenet network plugin would have a cluster selector which selects on the `NetworkProfile.NetworkPlugin` property specifically for kubenet, while its cluster mutator would set this property to kubenet so a new cluster can be created for it to run on.

Lastly, E2E scenarios also consist of a list of live VM validators. Each live VM validator consists of a description, a bash command which will actually be run on the newly bootstrapped VM, and an "asserter" function that will perform assertions on the contents of both the stdout and stderr streams that result from the execution of the command. The validators can be used to assert on numerous types of properties of the live VM, such as the live file system and kernel state.

You can find all implemented scenarios in the [scenario](scenario/) pacakge within files prefixed with `scenario_`. The `Scenario` struct definition can be found in [scenario/types.go](scenario/types.go).

### Implementation

To implement a new scenario, you need to do the following:

1. Create a new file in the scenario package directory named `scenario_<scenario-name>.go`
2. Within this new file, implement a private function with a representative name which returns a `*Scenario` representing the scenario's configuration
3. Add a call to the newly implemented function within the return value of the `scenarios()` function defined in [scenarios/init.go](scenario/init.go)
4. Implement any additional logic in the testing framework required by the new scenario

## Log Collection 

Each E2E scenario will generate its own logs after execution. Currently, these logs consist of:
- `cluster-provision.log` - CSE execution log, retrieved from `/var/log/azure/aks/cluster-provision.log` (collected in success and CSE failure cases)
- `kubelet.log` - the kubelet systemd unit's logs retrived by running `journalctl -u kubelet` on the VM after bootstrapping has finished (collected in success and CSE failure cases)
- `vmssId.txt` - a single line text file containing the unique resource ID of the VMSS created by the respective scenario, mainly collected for the purposes of posthoc resource deletion (collected in all cases where the VMSS is able to be created)

These logs will be uploaded in a bundle of the format:

```bash
└── scenario-logs
    └── <scenario>
        ├── cluster-provision.log
        ├── kubelet.log
        ├── vmssId.txt
```
