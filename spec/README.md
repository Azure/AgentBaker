# Shell scripts unit tests

Please visit the official [GitHub link](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec) for more details. Below is a brief use case.

## Installation 

`Shellspec` is used as a framework for unit test. There are 2 options to install it.

### Option 1 - recommended, using container to run it without installing anything!
We recently migrated to using container to run shellspec so that it supports all platforms!
`Shellspec` is already included in the makefile. You can build the dockerfile and run the tests by simply running `make shellspec` in root (/AgentBaker) directory. 

### Option 2 - install in your local machine (not preferred)
If you want to install it in your local machine, please run `curl -fsSL https://git.io/shellspec | sh`.

By default, it should be installed in `~/.local/lib/shellspec`. Please append it to the `$PATH` for your convenience. Example command `export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/lib/shellspec`.

## Authoring tests

You will need to write `xxx_spec.sh` file for the test.

For example, `AgentBaker/spec/parts/linux/cloud-init/artifacts/cse_install_spec.sh` is a test file for `AgentBaker/parts/linux/cloud-init/artifacts/cse_install.sh`

## Running tests locally

To run all tests, in AgentBaker folder, simply run `make shellspec` in root (/AgentBaker) directory. Another way is to run `docker run -v "$PWD:/src" shellspec-docker --shell bash --format d`.

### Useful commands for debugging
Assuming you have run at least once `make shellspec` to build the dockerfile locally,

- ```
  docker run -v "$PWD:/src" shellspec-docker --shell bash --xtrace
  ```
  With `--xtrace`, it will show verbose trace for debugging.

- ```
  docker run -t -v "$PWD:/src" shellspec-docker --shell bash --example <test name> -xtrace
  ```
  You can run a single test case by using `--example` followed by the test name. For example, `docker run -t -v "$PWD:/src" shellspec-docker --shell bash --example "sets PACKAGE_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL to packages.aks.azure.com when run locally"`. You can also add `--xtrace` to display verbose trace for this single test case.

- ```
  docker run -v "$PWD:/src" shellspec-docker --shell bash <path to xxx_spec.sh>
  ```
  By providing a full path a particular spec file, you can run only that spec file instead of all spec files in AgentBaker project. 
For example, `docker run -t -v "$PWD:/src" shellspec-docker --shell bash spec/parts/linux/cloud-init/artifacts/cse_helpers_spec.sh`

## Focus mode
You can also run shellspec in focus mode via the `make shellspec-focus` target. This will run shellspec with the `--focus` flag, which can be useful for debugging multiple test cases at once. For more details, please refer to the official shellspec docs regarding this feature: # allows usage of focus mode: https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#fdescribe-fcontext-fexamplegroup---focused-example-group.
